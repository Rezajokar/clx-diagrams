## CLX Diagrams

This is a catch all repoistory for visualizations relating to the work being conducted by the graduate research group in CMSC 35050.


### How to set it up
Begin by having node (preferrably a very current version, such as 8) and npm installed. Preferrably also yarn.

```sh
npm install
npm run start

# or if yarning
yarn
yarn start
```

Either option will open a browser window with the default content there.
